                            Even though I<br>
                            On my way, on my way, on my way down<br>
                            On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)<br>
                            You were the one that was tryna keep me way down<br>
                            But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)<br>

                        <p style="color:white;"> i dont know another picture that would depict or communicate what he is saying in his song but what i get from it is that this world has expectations and sterotypes of what a perfect human is supposed to look like and do<br>
                        but you dont have to follow them just be thankful for what you have and the life you were given because god made you in his image<br>
                        and you are unique to every other individual in this world<br>
                        and he's saying that he didnt look the best but he still made it with what he had<br>
                        and he talks about how people told him to change certain things about himselfbut he didnt because he wanted to give hope to those around him and show them that you dont have to be what the world says you have to be you just have to have hope<br>
                        then he goes on to adress cops locking up people and how he basically wants the violence to stop<br>
                        and we all get along without having to worry or be scared of whats to happen the next day or someone getting shot by assumption.<br>
